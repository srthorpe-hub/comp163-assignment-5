# comp163-assignment-5

    In this assignment I chose to use a while loop so that the program kept running unitl I reached my desired goal of reaching 1. I used a for loop in part two because I knew the range of possible divisors already. For challenge 3 I used a nested loop because there was a grid that needed to use multiple rows and columns which requiered a loop within a loop to execute.
